# Web Scraping, Data Cleaning, and Visualization: Unveiling Game of Thrones Insights

In this comprehensive project, I showcased my skills in web scraping, data cleaning, data manipulation, and data visualization by extracting, cleaning, and visualizing data related to the popular TV series "Game of Thrones."

To start the project, I utilized web scraping techniques to extract essential data from a dedicated Wikipedia page for Game of Thrones. This involved parsing the HTML content of the webpage and transforming it into a structured format suitable for analysis.

Once I obtained the raw data, I meticulously cleaned and preprocessed it. I removed redundant columns and performed data cleaning operations to enhance the quality and accuracy of the dataset. Additionally, I implemented data manipulation techniques to add meaningful labels and improve the overall readability of the information.

With a well-prepared dataset in hand, I showcased my proficiency in data visualization using Python's powerful libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. Through a variety of visualizations, including bar plots, scatter plots, stacked bar plots, and pie charts, I brought the Game of Thrones data to life. These visualizations unveiled valuable insights, such as the running length of episodes, the relationship between viewership and running time, the distribution of viewership across seasons, and the contribution of each season to the overall viewership.

This project serves as a testament to my skills in web scraping, data cleaning, data manipulation, and data visualization. By seamlessly integrating these techniques, I unearthed captivating insights from the Game of Thrones dataset, providing a comprehensive analysis of the series' viewership patterns and characteristics.
